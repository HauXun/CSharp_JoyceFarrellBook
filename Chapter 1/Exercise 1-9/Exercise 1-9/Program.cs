/*
From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways
all across the United States. There were always four or five signs in a row containing
pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read “Burma Shave.” For example, one
set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as follows:

Shaving brushes
You’ll soon see ’em
On a shelf
In some museum
Burma Shave

Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web and write a program named
BurmaShave that displays the rhyme.
